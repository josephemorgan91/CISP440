\subsection*{\textit{Determine weather each relation is a function fom X=\{1, 2, 3, 4\} to Y = \{a, b, c, d\}}}
\textbf{5.} 
\[\{(1, b), (2, b), (3, b), (4, b)\}\]

This relation is not a function, because there are multiple \textit{y} values which correspond to each \textit{x} value.

\subsection*{\textit{Determine weather each function in Exercises 10-15 is one-to-one.
		The domain of each function is the set of all real numbers. If the function is not
		one-to-one, exhibit distinct numbers a and b with f(a) = f(b). Also, determine
		weather f is onto the set of all real numbers. If f is not onto, exhibit a number y
		for which f(x) $\neq$ y for all real x.}}
\textbf{15.}
\[ f(x)=\frac{x}{1+x^2} \]

This function is one-to-one, which can be seen when the function is graphed. For each
$x$ value, there is one unique $y$ value. This function is not onto the set of all real
numbers. $f(x) \neq 10$ for all real $x$.

\textbf{28.}

Let $f$ and $g$ be functions from the positive real numbers to the positive real numbers
defined by the equations

\[ f(x) = \lfloor 2x \rfloor, \ \  g(x) = x^2 \]

Find the compositions of $f \circ f$, $g \circ g$, $f \circ g$, and $g \circ f$.

\[ f \circ f = f(f(x)) = f(\lfloor 2x \rfloor) = \lfloor 2(\lfloor 2x \rfloor) \rfloor\]
\[ g \circ g = g(g(x)) = g(x^2) = ((x^2)^2) = x^4\]
\[ f \circ g = f(g(x)) = f(x^2) = \lfloor 2x^2 \rfloor\]
\[ g \circ f = g(f(x)) = g(\lfloor 2x \rfloor) = (\lfloor 2x \rfloor)^2\]
\textbf{36.}

How many functions are there from $\{1, 2\}$ into $\{a, b\}$? Which are one-to-one? Which are onto?

Functions: 8

\[ \{(1, a)\} \]
\[ \{(2, a)\} \]
\[ \{(1, b)\} \]
\[ \{(2, b)\} \]
\[ \{(1, a), (2, a)\} \]
\[ \{(1, b), (2, b)\} \]
\[ \{(1, a), (2, b)\} \]
\[ \{(1, b), (2, a)\} \]

One-to-one: 6

\[ \{(1, a)\} \]
\[ \{(2, a)\} \]
\[ \{(1, b)\} \]
\[ \{(2, b)\} \]
\[ \{(1, a), (2, b)\} \]
\[ \{(1, b), (2, a)\} \]

Onto: 2

\[ \{(1, a), (2, b)\} \]
\[ \{(1, b), (2, a)\} \]
